# TXU

The **trade union** for:

```
Developers | Testers | Product    | Devops         |
PMs        | BAs     | UX         | Digital Design |
Sysadmins  | BOFHs   | 1337 4X0RZ | etc...
```

We represent over 10% of the UK economy and just like everyone else, we need:

* Protection
* Advancement
* Solidarity
* Representation

**It's time to get organised.**
